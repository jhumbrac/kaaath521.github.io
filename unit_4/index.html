			<p>In the classic computer game, <em>The Sims</em>, a character can stand in front of a mirror for an hour and gain charisma points. With these points, they are able to talk and influence others at ease. Well. If only it were that easy! No matter how long I talk in the mirror (wait, what?), I still find it hard to speak or write about myself. Instead, I've created a buzzword bio - you know, like all the annoying celebs on Twitter have!</p>
			<p><strong>Designer. Realist. List Maker. List Doer. List Crosser-Offer!(?)</strong></p>
